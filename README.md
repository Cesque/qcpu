# qcpu

## a fictional cpu implementation, with assembler and web  interface

**qcpu** is a fictional 16-bit CPU emulator written in node.js. It is inspired by the DCPU16 specification for the scrapped Mojang game [0x10c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0x10c), as well as [Zachtronics](http://www.zachtronics.com/)' assembly programming games. This repo contains scripts for running binary files, as well as an assembler for converting from a specialised assembly language (**qasm**) to binary. There is also a full CPU specification, so that other implementations can be written.
